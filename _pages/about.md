I am a first year CS PhD student with the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, Atlanta. I am advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz). My research is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Georgia Tech in May 2024, where my thesis focused on generating synthetic sensor data for human activity recognition via texts. I was advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz)
and [Prof. Hyeokhyen Kwon](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/hyeok-kwon.html).

## Research

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision and ubiquitous computing. A significant portion of my research focuses on generating synthetic/virtual sensor data from videos and texts to augment existing datasets for human activity recognition. This approach facilitates more robust and generalizable model training. Additionally, I've delved into sign language recognition, collaborating with [Prof. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thad-starner) and technologies for diabetes management in collaboration with [Prof. Rosa Arriaga](https://sites.google.com/view/riarriaga/home?authuser=0).
