I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing, advised by [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz). My research is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (NSF GRFP).

I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech in 2024, where I worked with [Prof. Thomas Ploetz](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/thomas-ploetz)
and [Prof. Hyeokhyen Kwon](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/hyeok-kwon.html) on generating synthetic sensor data for human activity recognition using text-based generative models. I’m broadly interested in how AI and sensing technologies can model and understand human behavior in realistic, privacy-preserving ways.

## Research

My research lies at the intersection of ubiquitous computing, synthetic data generation, and large language models (LLMs). I build intelligent simulation systems where LLM-guided embodied agents generate virtual sensor data—such as motion, ambient, and wearable signals—inside realistic environments. This work aims to scale human activity recognition (HAR) beyond the limits of costly, privacy-sensitive real-world data. I’m also interested in how these generative frameworks can bridge text, video, and sensor modalities, enabling diverse and generalizable models for human-centered AI.
